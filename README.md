## Details

Our chatbot is designed to provide you with an easy and convenient way to interact with our restaurant. Our chatbot uses buttons as the input method, so you can easily navigate through the chatbot by clicking on the available options.

### Main Menu:

When you open the chatbot, you will see our main menu. The main menu includes the following options:

- Place Order: View our restaurant's menu and prices.
- CheckOut Order: Checkout your order and see your total price.
- Order History: See the history of the orders you have made.
- Current Order: See all orders you have made and haven't checked out.
- Cancel Order: Cancel any order you have made and haven't been checked out.

#### Place Order
To view our restaurant's menu and prices, click on the "Place Order" option in the main menu. You will see a list of available food you can order. Each available food comes with a "Order Now" button which when you click, an order is registered.

#### CheckOut Order
To check out your order, click on the "CheckOut Order" option to see your total price. If you haven't made an order yet, then you will be given options to pick a food item.

#### Order History
To see a history of order you have made before, click on the "See Order History" to see all the orders which have been checkout and otherwise. If you haven't made an order yet, then you will be given options to pick a food item.

#### Current Order
To see all current orders you have made and haven't checked out yet, you can click the "See Current Order" option. If you haven't made an order yet, then you will be given options to pick a food item.
